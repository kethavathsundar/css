      The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being 
        "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
        It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history.
        The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
        <P>
          The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, 
            who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.
            Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, 
            while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.
      The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal  
        </P>
      It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting
        in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south,
        the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD.

        College Life is one of the most remarkable and lovable times of an 
        individual's life.For every person, College Life has a different 
        meaning. While some people spend their college life by partying with 
        friends, others become more cautious about their career and study hard.
        <P>
            We are missing everything from our college life due to this COVID-19. Everything 
            is online, your practicals and labs too. How can someone learn to execute a 
            circuit by just seeing through their computer. Good Morning! Am I audible?
            has become new way of greeting. This is so frustating. we pop out of bed ,
            turn on our computer, log into class and mentally log out and simply go to bed.
            Who cares? It's online. Although some teachers and seniors have tried to make it
            interesting but all those go in vain because  online classes drive them to all
             other online platforms paying less attention in class. 
        </P>
        There should  be an approach for a halt to the online classes and proceeding with 
        the regular offline classes to provide a better frame for a student’s learning in
        the classroom environment, physically meeting everyone, talking face to face, 
        and clearing all our doubts instantly. “Though every little thing can be
        compassed online, it cannot replicate all the aspects of offline classes."
